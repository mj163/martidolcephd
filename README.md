PHD Work

This project is relevant to several current business and personal needs associated with the R. Dolce Group (http://rdolcegroup.com) as well as identifying possible research topics for my PHD.  I know the base will be Education, but I'm leaning toward Research and Technology more so than leadership.  

Because I'm not sure, I've elected to post my thoughts and theories using the very same technologies I intend to use in my research materials and data.  Hopefully at the end of this journey, I'll have some things figured out. 

Being true to myself, whatever I learn I will post it not because of a need to satisfy some long forgotten vanity or ego; but because maybe this is what it means to be woke.  Maybe it means that if you want to spread your truth, then maybe the first step in the journey is to open it up for others.  At best; it will be an automatic validation of your crazy or your genius.  Regardless - if your need is greater; if your need is nothing more than to help someone like you learn to cope - well; again; it's a need for validation.  I can be honest about that.  

What I don't know - Is Why.  So I'm going to post it and maybe I'll figure it out along the way.
